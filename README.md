# My Board Game

This is currently at the stage of experiment, and will hopefully become a board game framework.

## Roadmap

### Backend

1. [checked] Find a reasonable class structure
2. [ongoing] Mock test for SignalR-based game hub
3. Implement the game "Top Ten", refactor current design
4. Implement room separation
5. Security

### Frontend

1. [checked?] Learn basics of Angular
2. [ongoing] Implement basic hub connection service
3. Wait for backend design to stabilize

### TODOs

- Is there a way to define game protocol for both backend and frontend

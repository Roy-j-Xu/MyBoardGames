# My Board Game

This is currently at the stage of experiment, and will hopefully become a board game framework.

### Backend

- User management
- Game hub management

### Frontend

- Game implementation

### TODOs

- Find a protocol to connect frontend commands and backend game states
- Should I use Redux pattern for state management?
- How to implement count down?
